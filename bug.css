The CSS code contains an invalid or unsupported property. This often happens when using vendor prefixes incorrectly or using properties that are not part of the CSS specification. For example, using a non-standard property like `-webkit-border-radius` without knowing the browser compatibility or using a property that is deprecated can cause unexpected rendering behavior or errors. Another example is specifying units incorrectly like using `px` for margin but `em` for padding which can result in unexpected layout issues.
